DESCRIPTION OF OUR SERVICES.</b> TalentZoom is an online recruiting marketplace. Our Services allow individuals seeking employment opportunities (each, a “<b>Job Seeker</b>”) to connect with companies seeking to recruit such individuals (each, an “<b>Employer</b>”). We serve as intermediary between Job Seekers and Employers. TalentZoom is not involved in any contract of employment and is not bound by any contractual agreement arising between Job Seekers and Employers, whether or not TalentZoom receives some form of remuneration in connection with the transaction. Upon registering as a Job Seeker, you may be matched with an Employer and receive a request to interview (“<b>Interview Request</b>”). When matched with an Employer, your Personal Information (as defined below) will be visible and accessible by Employers and the Employers can also ask for additional information about you.  You may, in your sole discretion, accept or reject an Interview Request. Your interaction with an Employer may result in the Employer extending an offer for employment to you (“<b>Job Offer</b>”). You may, in your sole discretion, accept or reject a Job Offer.</p>\n              <p><b>2. ELIGIBILITY.</b> This is a contract between you and TalentZoom. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with TalentZoom, and only in compliance with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Please read these Employer Terms of Service (“<b>Terms of Service</b>”) carefully. By logging in and accessing the Site and by accepting our performance of Services, Employer acknowledges that Employer has read, understood, and agrees to be legally bound by these Terms of Service and to the collection and use of Employer information as set forth in our Privacy Policy. </p>\n              <p>These Terms of Service may be updated by us from time to time with or without notice to Employer, and so Employer should review this page periodically. When material changes are made to these Terms of Service, we will update the “<b>Last Updated</b>” date at the top of this document, and notify Employer that material changes have been made. Employer’s continued use of the Site and/or Services constitutes Employer’s acceptance of such change(s). EMPLOYER AGREES TO REGULARLY CHECK THE SITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS OF SERVICE.</p>\n              <p><b>1. DESCRIPTION OF OUR SERVICES.</b> TalentZoom is an online recruiting marketplace. Our Services allow Employers to connect with individuals seeking employment opportunities (each, a “<b>Job Seeker</b>”). We serve as intermediary between Job Seekers and Employers. TalentZoom is not involved in any contract of employment and is not bound by any contractual agreement arising between Job Seekers and employers, whether or not TalentZoom receives some form of remuneration in connection with the transaction.  Upon registering as an employer, Employer will be assigned a TalentZoom contact who will be responsible for the day-to-day management of Employer’s account (“<b>Account Partner</b>”). Employers will be able to view the collection of candidate profiles on www.talentzoom.io/jobseekers. If Employer would like to obtain additional information about a specific Job Seeker, Employer can do so by contacting your Account Partner. If Employer is interested in initiating a contact with a particular Job Seeker, Employer will be able to initiate the contact through the use of our Services by sending an interview request to the Job Seeker through the Services (each, an “<b>Interview Request</b>”) or through the Account Partner. Employer’s interaction with a Job Seeker may result in an offer for employment (“<b>Job Offer</b>”). Job Seekers may, in their sole discretion, accept or reject an Interview Request and/or a Job Offer.</p>\n              <p><b>2. RIGHTS TO THE SERVICES.</b> Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, Employer’s use of the Site shall be considered to be a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable right to use the Site and the Services only and as permitted by the features of the Services. TalentZoom reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the TalentZoom Content (as defined below). TalentZoom may terminate these provisions or rights at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>\n              <p><b>3. CHANGES TO THE SERVICES.</b> We may, without prior notice, make changes, correction or improvements to the Services; stop providing the Services or features of the Services, to Employer or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Services. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend Employer’s access to the Services without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination Employer violates any provision of these Terms of Service, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, Employer continues to be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>\n              <p><b>4. REGISTRATION.</b> In order to access and use the Services, Employer must activate an Employer account. Employer may never use another user’s account without permission. During the onboarding process, Employer will have to provide Employer’s name, email address, and company name, and Employer will be asked to create a password for Employer’s account. Employer represents and warrants that all registration information Employer submits to us is truthful, complete and accurate, and Employer will maintain the accuracy of such information. Employer is solely responsible for the confidentiality of Employer’s account and for the activity that occurs on the account, and Employer must keep Employer’s account password secure. We encourage Employer to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) for Employer’s account. Employer will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate Employer’s account. We reserve the right to delete or change Employer’s account at any time and for any reason. We are under no obligation to accept any individual or entity as an Employer, and may accept or reject any registration in our sole and complete discretion. Employer must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of Employer’s account. TalentZoom will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of Employer’s account.</p>\n              <p>Employer may control Employer’s account and how Employer interacts with the Services by changing the settings. By providing TalentZoom Employer’s email address Employer consents to our using the email address to send Employer Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use Employer’s email address to send Employer other messages, such as changes to features of the Services and special offers. If Employer does not want to receive such email messages, Employer may opt out or change Employer’s preferences in Employer’s settings.  Opting out may prevent Employer from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>\n              <p><b>5. FEES.</b> Employer agrees to pay all applicable fees that are set forth on www.talentzoom.io/fees (“<b>Fees</b>”). Employer also agrees that any assignee or successor of Employer’s contractual obligations by virtue of a sale, exit or change of control transaction will also be obligated to pay any success fees for Job Seekers that Employer discovers through the Services.</p>\n              <p><b>7. USE OF PERSONAL DATA.</b> Employer’s use of Services may involve the transmission to us of certain personally-identifiable information.
